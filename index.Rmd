Redlining, a discriminatory practice that denied resources and opportunities to neighborhoods based on racial and economic factors, has left a lasting impact on cities across the United States. In New York City, the echoes of this policy are still visible today, shaping access to essential services and community health.

This project delves into the relationship between historical redlining and present-day disparities in access to healthy grocery stores and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) enrollment. By examining these connections, we aim to shed light on how systemic inequities continue to affect New Yorkers and inspire conversations about solutions for a more equitable future.
